# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. By identifying customers who are likely to leave, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them and reduce revenue loss.

---

## ✅ Project Goals

- **Predict** which customers are at high risk of churning.
- **Support** business teams with actionable insights to improve retention.
- **Demonstrate** a full machine learning pipeline, from raw data to deployment.

---

## 💼 Business Problem

**Customer churn** refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company.  
In the Telco dataset, churn is a binary field (`Yes` or `No`) that indicates whether a customer has canceled their subscription.

Reducing churn is crucial for telecom companies because:
- Acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones.
- Churn impacts recurring revenue and customer lifetime value (CLV).

---

## 📈 Business Value & KPIs

**Business Objective**: Predict churn in advance so that retention strategies can be deployed.

### KPIs Impacted:
- 🔁 **Churn Rate** – percentage of customers who leave in a given time period.
- 💰 **Revenue Saved** – retention of high-value customers avoids revenue loss.
- 🔒 **Retention Rate** – percentage of customers retained.
- 📉 **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** – average total revenue from retained users.

---

## 🔮 Use Cases

- 📢 **Marketing teams** can run targeted campaigns for at-risk customers.
- 🎁 **Customer service** can offer proactive discounts or support.
- 📊 **Executives** can simulate retention strategies and assess ROI.

> ✅ Example: “Predict whether a customer is likely to churn in the next 30 days based on tenure, billing, and service usage patterns.”

## 🧱 Project Roadmap

### 🔹 Phase 1: Define Scope & Value (✅ You are here)

- ✅ Define churn and its business impact.
- ✅ Identify KPIs and use cases.

### 🔹 Phase 2: Data Pipeline Setup
- Load raw CSV
- Clean and standardize data
- Feature engineering (e.g., tenure groups, charge ratios)
- Save cleaned dataset

### 🔹 Phase 3: Model Development
- Exploratory data analysis
- Handle imbalance (SMOTE or stratified split)
- Build and evaluate models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Track metrics (ROC AUC, Recall)
- Save final model

### 🔹 Phase 4: Dashboard & Insights
- Churn rate by customer type
- Visualize feature importance
- Retention scenario simulation

### 🔹 Phase 5: API & Deployment (Optional)
- FastAPI endpoint for real-time churn prediction
- Dockerization & local/cloud deployment

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Finalize README and business understanding (this step!)
2. ⏳ Build the data pipeline (`pipeline/ingest_data.py`, `transform_data.py`)
3. 📊 Begin EDA and model training
4. 🧠 Tune models, evaluate, and interpret
5. 🖥️ Build dashboard + simulate business value
6. 🌐 Optional: deploy model with API for real-time use
